This is the R package I made to help run the scripts. Included are the important tables to run (Food, default stat values for ilvl such as Intelligence, Crit Rate and Spell Speed) as well as the batch BiS script that's actually used.

I'm not super familiar with other people using my code, a lot of this is archival just in case the worst happens. If you run into any issues, let me know on Discord!
